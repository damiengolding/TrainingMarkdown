# Bash scripts

## Script structure
Header:

    #!/bin/bash
    #!/usr/bin/env zsh

Comment:

    # To end of line

## Variables
Untyped:

    VariableName=VariableValue
    echo $VariableValue

Typed:

    declare option VariableName=VariableValue
	
	Constant (read only): declare -r Pi=3.14
    Integer: declare -i PhoneNumber=12345678912
    Array: declare -a MyArray or declare -a MyArray([elem1 elem2 elem3]) 
	Associative array: declare -A MyAssocArray([k1]=v1 [k2]=v2 [k3]=v3)

Arrays:

	tempArray=(v1,v2,v3)
    tempArray[n]
    $tempArray[1] (gives v2)

Named/associative array:

    declare -A PhoneBook
To add:

    PhoneBook[name]="user1"
    PhoneBook[number="12345 678912"
To retrieve:

    ${PhoneBook[name]}
    ${PhoneBook[number]}

## Comparison operators
Text (older versions of bash):

    Is equal to: if[ "$a" -eq "$b"] - 1 == true, 0 == false
    Is not equal to: if[ "$a" -ne "$b"]
    Greater than: if[ "$a" -gt "$b"]
    Greater than or equal to: if[ "$a" -ge "$b"]
    Less than: if[ "$a" -lt "$b"]
    Less than or equal to: if[ "$a" -le "$b"]

Symbols (newer versions of bash) - needs double parentheses:

    Less than: (("$a"<"$b"))

String comparisons:

    Equals: if[ "$a"="$b" ]
    Equals: if[ "$a"==="$b" ]
    Not equals: if[ "$a"!="$b" ]
    Is less than (ASCII order): if["$a"\<"$b"]
    Is less than (ASCII order): if[["$a"<"$b"]]

## Control constructs
### if/if else
    if[you_can_keep_your_head_while_all_around_are_losing_theirs]
    	then
    		# you'll be a man my son
    fi
    
    if[condition1]
    	then
    		# do stuff
    elif[condition2]
    	then
    		# do some other stuff
    else
    	# all else has failed
    fi

### for (for do done)
    for entry in {1..5}
    	do
    		echo $entry
    done

### while (while do done)
    counter=1
    while[counter -lt 10]
    	do
    		echo $counter
    		((counter++))
    done
	echo "Finished"

### until (until do done)
    counter=1
    until[counter -gt 10]
    	do
    		echo $counter
    		((counter++))
    done
	echo "Finished"

### String operations
Substring:

    testString="testString"
    echo ${testString:2:4}
    Output: st S


### I/O
Console write/read:

    echo "Enter your name"
    read UserName
    echo "Hello $UserName!"

File I/O:

    TempFile=$(<test.txt) - possibly followed by echo "$TempFile"
    Clobber write: echo "Hello world" > test.txt
    Append write: echo "Hello world" >> test.txt
